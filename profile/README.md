# Oh, hello there 👋

Cublix Studios is *not really an organization*, but more of a group of let's say.. not the best developers 😅
If you want to get involved in our little team or group you can email us at **brawlmod@proton.me**
Oh, you are wondering where the link to our [Roblox development group](https://www.roblox.com/communities/14867533/Cublix-Studios#!/about) is?
We don't like people with no humor! We want our team to be always full of "happy" coders!!

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
